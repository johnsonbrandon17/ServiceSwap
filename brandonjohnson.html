		Name: Brandon Johnson<br><br>
		Phone: 1-231-519-0014<br><br>
		Email: johnsb17@ferris.edu<br><br>

		I am a senior in the Computer Information System program.  I used to code HTML, CSS, and PHP when I was in middle school and high school.  Since college, however, I haven't used much of any coding language outside of 		class, therefore my skills are dusty.<br><br>

  		I'm a good problem solver, and enjoy working with people.  While I may be new to some services such as GitHub, I'm not new to website resources such as Cpanel.
